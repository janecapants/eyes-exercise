# Eye Excerise
## This project shows the center of two eyes following the cursor.

## Description
### As soon as the page loads the pupils of the eyeballs on the center of the screen will follow your cursor as long as it is on the page. The eyes are set on top of a smiley face. The end product gives off a sort of creepy feel with the pupils being red and the sclera being black. 

## How to run it.
### You must download the zip file. Then open up the CSS, javascript, and html file last. 

## Furture Improvements
### I'd like to make the pupils change color when you click the screen. I tried to get that to happen with the final product this time, but could not figure it out.
